This is a companion resource to use along with Seumas' [Lingua Graecae Per Se Illustrata](https://github.com/seumasjeltzz/LinguaeGraecaePerSeIllustrata). I am not claiming an endorsement by Seumas though, as he had no idea that I was doing this.

If anyone wants to discuss, feel free to shoot me an email ([eric.sowell@gmail.com](mailto:eric.sowell@gmail.com)) or tweet at me ([@mallioch](https://twitter.com/mallioch))

Now, that's enough English.
